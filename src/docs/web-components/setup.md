# Web Component Setup

first install NodeJS if you haven't already.  .. go ahead, I'll wait. ..


OK. now that we've got that out of the way lets create a new project directory. Open up a terminal to a location that you can locate in the future.
```sh
cd ~/
mkdir senzing-web-component-example
cd senzing-web-component-example
```

now we're going to have nodejs set up a boilerplate package.json and install some dependencies.
```sh
npm init -q
```
